My name is Adil Dar I'm from Valley Stream NY.  
I enjoy playing basketball, videogames, 
MMA and UFC.  One of my goals in life is to create a successful tech company, 
I'm using my skills I'm learning as software engineer 
at RIT to achieve that.  I also like to program 
and would like to learn much more about it.
